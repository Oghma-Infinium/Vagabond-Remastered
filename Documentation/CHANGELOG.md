### 0.3.17

Key Info

**Ignore missing plugins warning when loading a save. It doesn't matter!**

If using [**Maintained Magic**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114983), unapply maintained spells before updating and re-apply the maintained spells after updating.

After updating and loading your existing character, save and close the game, then [clean your save](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md#cleaning-saves). *This step is highly recommended.*

- Lots of bug fixes, too many to list all of them. See [Trello](https://trello.com/b/cVEDt7At/vagabond-remastered) for details. (thanks for all the bug reports)
- Reworked enemy scaling to try to ensure strength of each enemy is more consistent and appropriate for their level. This shouldn't make the list easier or harder, just more consistent.
- Added ceiling to level scaling on enemy spawns in many dungeons which previously had unlimited level scaling. Now each dungeon should a maximum level for enemies that can spawn there.
- Lots of tweaks and fixes to Dac0da for stuff I encountered on personal playthrough.
- Fixed an issue where entering bleedout state (fallback when respawn doesn't work) did not properly heal enemies in the area.
- Timed Block on a spell with Apocalypse Proof perk now sends back most projectiles back towards attacker.
- Removed one Whiterun horse statue which I think was causing a crash sometimes.
- Removed [Security Overhaul SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58224) and addons because I realized it was redundant when the list doesn't have lockpicking minigame.
- Added [Japhet's Folly Paper Map for FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/158551)
- Added [Wyrmstooth - NPCs Refined](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159863)
- Updated bunch of mods to latest versions

### 0.3.16

Key Info

**Ignore missing plugins warning when loading a save. It doesn't matter!**

If using [**Maintained Magic**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114983), unapply maintained spells before updating and re-apply the maintained spells after updating.

After updating and loading your existing character, save and close the game, then [clean your save](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md#cleaning-saves). *This step is highly recommended.*

- Lots of bug fixes, too many to list all of them. See [Trello](https://trello.com/b/cVEDt7At/vagabond-remastered) for details. (thanks for all the bug reports)
- Some UI tweaks, such as changing style of HUD attribute bars and some text boxes.
- Reduced frequency of extra enchanted drops from RPG loot, as the drop rates were clearly excessive. Has no impact on other enchanted loot.
  - Does not affect containers/NPCs already loaded by the save.
- Fixed some circular leveled list errors, causing potentially unexpected/unintended outcomes from loot drops.
- Fixed issues with Bow overhaul when entering dialogue menus.
- Fixed bow rapid shot applying enchantment effects even with zero charge.
- Fixed Fool's Gold enchant not properly killing the player when unequipped with insufficient gold.
- Disabled Bound Weapon enchantments from NPCs as it caused buggy behavior.
- Reworked Breton racial skill Stones of Gallen for Tower Stone as the default one had no effect. It now gives +2 to lockpicking dice rolls.
- More tweaks on boss balance.

### 0.3.15

Key Info

**Ignore missing plugins warning when loading a save. It doesn't matter!**

If using [**Maintained Magic**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114983), unapply maintained spells before updating and re-apply the maintained spells after updating.

After updating and loading your existing character, save and close the game, then [clean your save](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md#cleaning-saves). *This step is highly recommended.*

- Lots of bug fixes, too many to list. See [Trello](https://trello.com/b/cVEDt7At/vagabond-remastered) for details. (thanks for all the bug reports)
- Complete bow gameplay rework, with custom combination of [Bow Rapid Combo V3](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89308), [MCO Skyrim Hunter Bow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114608) and [Dynamic Dodge Shot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114101)
  - Kick Attack (Unlocked by default): While holding a bow or crossbow, press the power attack button to perform a quick melee kick to deal light damage at close range and stagger the opponent.
  - Rapid Shot (Requires Bow Mastery Rank 1): Tap the attack button repeatedly to fire a rapid stream of arrows. This attack consumes ammunition and Stamina less efficiently, but delivers much higher DPS compared to standard bow drawing.
  - Dodge Shot (Requires Bow Mastery Rank 2): With a fully drawn arrow, press the dodge button to fire instantly while performing a dodge with extended distance. Great for avoiding attacks while staying on the offensive.
  - Backflip Shot (Requires Bow Mastery Rank 2): While sprinting, press the bash button to leap backwards and fire at the same time. This move creates distance from enemies, letting you disengage quickly while dealing damage.
  - The entire Archery skill tree is overhauled with these changes in mind.
  - Baseline Marksman physical damage has been increased to make the playstyle more competitive with melee builds.
  - Bows now come with a default Weapon Art. Unique Weapon Arts also work with bows if you have the Artkeeper’s Legacy perk.
- Bash now gives Timed Block frames, effectively working like a parry. Applies to bow bash too. (Still requires the first Block perk to function)
- Waterbreathing effects from spells, enchantments and potions now replaced with Fortify Swim Speed, as the player already had unlimited breath underwater by default
  - Obviously, I might have missed some, Argonian racial passive for instance still remains unchanged.
  - If the Waterbreathing spell is already learned, the change to Deep Dive (swim speed buff) might not apply.
- Removed many remaining Odin spells which had identical variant from Mysticism
  - If you have already learned these spells, they won't get removed
- Made Vigilant boss summon spells unobtainable, as killing them unintentionally grants perk points, and they never were part of intended summoner balance in the list
  - If you have already learned these spells, they won't get removed
- Further adjusted stat scaling of some bosses in mod-added content

### 0.3.14

Key Info

**Ignore missing plugins warning when loading a save. It doesn't matter!**

If using [**Maintained Magic**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114983), unapply maintained spells before updating and re-apply the maintained spells after updating.

After updating and loading your existing character, save and close the game, then [clean your save](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md#cleaning-saves). *This step is highly recommended.*

- Added [Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090), [Odin - Skyrim Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) and [Summermyst - Enchantments of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6285)
  - [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) and [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) still take priority for overhauling vanilla spells and enchantments!
  - Some spells/enchantments with overlapping design or bad balance implications were culled
  - May take up to 2 in-game days for vendor and loot lists to update with the new items
- Added Halgari's RPG loot Synthesis patcher
  - It makes almost all non-enchanted loot have 5% chance to get 1 enchantment and 1% chance to get 2 enchantments
  - Has no effect on existing enchanted loot, so this is basically a pure bonus to amount of enchanted gear you will find
  - The randomizer gear only contains enchantments from Thaumaturgy and Summermyst
- Reduced drop rate of Grand Insight from most containers
- Buffed extra loot from locked containers, including the chance to get Grand Insight
- Moved dodge related perks from Sneak skill tree to Weapon Arts tree
  - Unfortunately this means that if you've already taken the perks form Sneak tree, they are reverted to default Vokord ones which buff the sneak roll

### 0.3.13

Key Info

- Reworked the respawn mechanic. Now the last location you slept at is saved as the default respawn point. You must sleep once after the update to register a point, otherwise Bannered Mare is the default location.
  - Works with tent bedrolls from [Campsite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22353) as a portable respawn point.
- Introduced Grand Insight, a rare potion that grants 1 perk point when consumed, up to 20 total, after which the potion grants 50 Greater Insight points instead.
  - These can be found as very rare loot in dungeon chests, with higher chance from locked chests. There are also 15 of them placed in the world in very hidden locations.
  - Smithing perk Seeker's End (100) allows the player to just craft these potions with 5 Void Shards.
- Overhauled even more NPC outfits, with focus on Fine Clothes and Priest Robes.
- Gave enemy NPC Dremoras unique 2H moveset
- Made some bosses of Skyrim Boss Overhaul have reasonable stamina values, previously being practically unlimited
- Nerfed the damage of dragon breath attacks by around 30%

- Reduced the weight of Essence and Refined Essence from 0.5 to 0.1
- Reduced the lightning damage weakness of conductive armor from 33% to 10%
- Added Wound Dressing consumable which increases health regeneration by 100% for 5 minutes, but the effect is instantly removed when receiving an unblocked hit.
  - Wound Dressings can be crafted on tanning rack with 1 linen wrap + common alcohol types. They are also found as common loot from many enemy NPCs.

- Fixed a common crash in Dragonsreach

### 0.3.8

Key Info

**Ignore missing plugins warning when loading a save. It doesn't matter!**

- Removed [Drugs for Bandits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112760) mod because the impact of bandits constantly using Skooma or Sleeping Tree Sap was actually annoying and caused some bandits to literally commit suicide
