## FAQ

### Q: Do I have to read this?
A: No, but if you ask me any question on this document, I will refer you back to here.

### Q: Can I delete the downloads?
A: You can delete or move the download folder after Wabbajack is finished. However, when redownloading or updating the list Wabbajack will redownload *all* files that it can not find proper matches for, so consider this if you have slow internet, don't have nexus premium, or value your time in general.

### Q: Can I uncap the FPS?
A: The list is capped to 61 FPS by default. While [SSE Display Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34705) adjusts timing values based on framerate to prevent physics from spazzing out at high framerates, some mods may use havok code that still rely on a ~60 FPS cap to prevent physics-based issues. If you wish to uncap the FPS, then you can do so in the ENB menu by prressing `END` in-game.

### Q: Why does unsheating weapons put me in third-person? Can I play the list in first-person?
A: The list is designed for third-person gameplay and first-person combat is not supported at all. Do not report any first-person gameplay related issues to me, I don't care.

### Q: How do I change my character's body appearance?
A: In racemenu when creating your character or after by opening the OBody menu with `;` (check or change the keybind in the OBody MCM if you do not have a QWERTY keyboard).

### Q: How do I start the main questline?  
A: [Skyrim Unbound Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962) skips the 1st Act of the main questline. Dragons will start spawning at level 15, or earlier at certain locations. After slaying your first dragon, `Way of the Voice quest` starts.

### Q: How do I start Dac0da?
A: Read the [Gameplay Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/Documentation/GAMEPLAY.md#quests-changes).

### Q: I can't find Altano in the Windpeak Inn. / How do I start VIGILANT?  
A: Read the [Gameplay Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/Documentation/GAMEPLAY.md#quests-changes).

### Q: How do I start UNSLAAD?
A: Read the [Gameplay Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/Documentation/GAMEPLAY.md#quests-changes).

### Q: How do I set up the quick wheel?
A: There is extensive documentation on the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345).

### Q: I can't add a weapon/armor to the wheel.
A: This is usually caused by an alternate start mod that adds random items to your inventory. This only happens to the set of starting items you have. To fix this issue, simply drop the item onto the ground and pick it again.

### Q: Can I still use the vanilla favorites menu? I do not like the wheel.
A: If you're on controller press `LT + start` to open up the vanilla favorites menu.

### Q: Can I add/remove [insert mod] to the list?
A: Yes, but if you have to ask, no. Also adding or removing a mod would void any official support.

### Q: Will you add [insert mod] to the list?
A: Use the `#vagabond-remastered-requests` channel on discord (when it is available) if you want to suggest mods.

### Q: Will you add OStim/SexLab to the list?
A: No

## Known Issues

### Failed to create download folder!
Solution(s)
 1. Upon opening MO2 you may get a error warning like this: `Failed to create "D:\Downloads" Your user account probably lacks permission`. This is due to Wabbajack not changing the ini file of MO2. To fix this find the file `ModOrganizer.ini` inside the same folder as the MO2 exe is and change the line: `download_directory=D:\Downloads` to `download_directory=Your Prefered Download Folder`. It's best to find the line inside the ini by using `ctrl + F`.

### When leveling up skills, new perk nodes do not get highlighted until exiting and re-entering the perk menu!
Solution(s)
 1. This is a bug with advancing skills while inside of an active menu. I won't fix this, it's a minor visual bug, the perks can still be selected even if you don't exit and re-enter menu.

### Night Eye effects do not work well!
Solution(s)
 1. This is an issue with IMODs and ENB not playing together nicely, unfortunately fixing Night Eye effects would require us to rewrite a large amount of the shader code for parts of the ENB used by the list, and we have decided that it is not worthwhile to do this.

### Not receiving Courier Letter from Dark Brotherhood!
Solution(s)
 1. This appears to happen rarely, but from my testing as long as you sleep in a bed they should still abduct you as intended. Not sure what is causing this as of yet.

### Being randomly attacked or arrested by NPCs!
Solution(s)
 1. open the console, select one of the NPCs, and type `paycrimegold 0 0`

### [Insert Male NPC] looks like he has tits / has a really big chest and arms!
Solution(s)
 1. Change their OBody preset, do not report this as an issue to me, I'm tired of hearing about it.

### Widgets overlap TrueHUD Attributes Widget!
Solution(s)
 1. Seems to be a rare bug and it's fixed on game restart, not sure of cause.

### Stuck in slow motion!
Solution(s)
 1. Bug with Wheeler, just reopen and close the wheel.

### Can't put an item into Wheeler!
Solution(s)
 1. Drop the item and pick it back up, this is usually an issue with items that are added via a script not properly initializing as a reference. 

## Known Crashes

### Wheeler.dll Crash!
> [!NOTE]  
> This should no longer be an issue as of version 2.0+  

**Cause**: Wheeler typically crashes for one of two reasons: 
1. You slotted player-made potions in Wheeler and ran out of them.  
   **Fix**: Do not put player-made potions in Wheeler.  
2. You no longer have an item in your inventory that Wheeler is trying to reference.  
   **Fix**: Open dMenu (Default: `Home`). Navigate to Wheeler Controls --> Reset All Wheels. **This will reset your current Wheeler configuration**.

### Crashing after loading a save!
> [!NOTE]  
> This issue should happen significantly less as of version 3.0+  

**Cause** Skyrim has a multitude of issues when it comes to loading back game data without restarting the game.
**Fix**: You can try the experimental fix below, but note that this bug is due to some deeply rooted issues with the base game engine and it is out of my control to do anything about it.

<Details>
<summary>Experimental Fix for crash on load (after dying, after fast travel, from a carriage ride, or just reloading a save game)</summary>

  1.  Navigate to `[Your Vagabond Remastered Install Location]\profiles\Vagabond Remastered\SkyrimPrefs.ini`  
  2.  Change `uLargeRefLODGridSize =9`  
  3.  to `uLargeRefLODGridSize =5`  
  4.  save changes (CTRL+S)  

This will reduce quality of some large objects at far away distance. **The difference is very minor you're unlikely to even notice it.** Might improve performance as well.
