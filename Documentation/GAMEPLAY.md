# Initial Setup

Before reading this guide, please follow the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/README.md) as it will answer the vast majority of technical questions related to getting the list setup and running. Be sure to check out the [Configuration](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md) page to learn more about the controller support, optional tweaks, addons, MCM options, and more.

# Overview and Basics

This section will cover the absolute basics of the list. I suggest reading, or skimming all of the linked mod pages in this section if you are unfamiliar with the preceding mods.

Before reading this section, I suggest looking over the [load order](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/vagabond-remastered-2) and [keybinds](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/images/Keybinds.png).

## Core Overhauls

 - Vagabond Remastered uses [Vokord](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129564) as the perk overhaul, with major custom modifications, such as custom Timed Block branch for the Block skill tree and a Weapon Arts skill tree. Additionally, some perks from [aljo's Paragon perks](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Apostasy/blob/main/GAMEPLAY.md#paragon---a-modern-perk-overhaul) are added.
 - [Roleplaying in Skyrim - Encounter Zones](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/149899) is used for overhauling vanilla encounter zones. [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681) overhauls the loot balance.
 - [Imperious](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315) overhauls the races, combined with classes from [Nirn's Chosen](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121427).
 - Standing Stones are covered by mix of [Stones of Sacrifice](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121629) and [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411)
 - Vagabond Remastered uses Archon - Faiths of Tamriel, aljo's amazing custom-made religion mod. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Apostasy/blob/main/GAMEPLAY.md#archon---faiths-of-tamriel)!
 - [Sacrilege](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42408/) and [Growl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245) overhaul the Vampire and Werewolf systems.
 - [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) and [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) cover Alchemy and Enchanting respectively.
 - [Artificer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99619), [Artifacts of the Ancestors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92389), and [Mysterious Mementos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118342) overhaul unique artifacts and add several new ones.
 - [Forceful Tongue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276) overhauls the vanilla shouts. Speech perk tree also contains shout improving perks.
 - [Gourmet](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96876) overhauls food and drink, transforming the traditional "eat 30 cheese wheels mid combat" into a more complex buff system.
 - [Starfrost](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97536) manages the Survival changes, such as Exhaustion, Hunger, and Warmth.


## Combat Foundations

The following mods are considered the "foundations" of the combat and gameplay for Vagabond Remastered:
 - [Attack MCO|DXP](https://www.distaranimation.com/mods/attack) (Maxsu edition) is the foundational overhaul for melee combat in the list.
 - [Spell Hotbar 2](https://github.com/pWn3d1337/Skyrim_SpellHotbar2) overhauls magic gameplay and is recommended to be used over vanilla casting.
 - [TK Dodge RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956) adds Dodging to the game.
   - Dodges are based on Armor Type. Heavy Armor and Cloth users gets a shorter step dodge with shortened iframes, Light Armor gets a longer roll dodge with longer iframes.
   - The Sneak skill tree has multiple perks to upgrade your Dodge efficiency.
 - [Maxsu Poise](https://github.com/max-su-2019/MaxsuPoise/blob/master/docs/en/Mechanics%20Manual.md) and [Modern Stagger Lock](https://github.com/max-su-2019/ModernStaggerLock) implement a Poise system, which has been fine tuned for the list.
 - **Custom Timed Blocking**: If you block just before enemy hit, gain increased block efficiency with a chance to stagger the attacker.
   - Unlocked by obtaining the very first perk in the Block skill tree.
   - The Block skill tree has multiple perks to upgrade Timed Block with additional effects and bonuses. 
 - **Custom Weapon Arts system**: Unlocked by taking the first perk in the Weapon Arts skill tree, allowing use of powerful special attacks.
   - The basic Weapon Art chooses an attack based on weapon type, but more can be obtained through various unique weapons.
   - By default, the Weapon Art of an unique weapon can be used only with that specific armament, but with the Artkeeper's Legacy perk from Weapon Arts skill tree, unique Weapon Arts become available while wielding any weapon.
   - Weapons featuring unique Weapon Arts can be crafted with **Void Shards** obtained from killing bosses. The exact recipes can be seen in the forge crafting menu when you have at least one Void Shard in your inventory.
   - Additionally, some daedric artifacts possess unique Weapon arts.

List of all unique Weapon Arts available in the list. New ones will be added over time as I update the list!

# Leveling and Progression

Vagabond Remastered modifies the vanilla leveling experience in a way to reward the player for engaging in the world in sensible ways. While perks can be obtained through leveling, the perks gained from leveling alone are unlikely to be sufficient for sustaining a full character build in late game. Below is a general breakdown of what to expect with the leveling and progression system in Vagabond Remastered.

## Changes to Leveling

Vagabond Remastered uses [Insightful Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79951) with a custom patch for [FTweaks Skill Increase Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/124253). Additional sources for insight are added in the list, including quest rewards and various bosses. [Skyshards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60748) also grant insight, NOT perk points like base mod does.

## Perk Point Acquisition

Vagabond Remastered takes a mixed approach to the acquisition of perks. 

- Each level-up grants one perk point
- Dragon and unique boss kills grant one perk point, with a cap of 50 in a playthrough
- With default start settings the player starts with 3 free perk points at level 1

# New and Notable Mechanics

- By default health regeneration is reduced by -100%, effectively negating natural health regeneration. All bonuses for health regeneration still remain as affective as vanilla.
- Stamina and magicka regeneration are reduced by -50% during combat to encourage more careful resource management and preparation. Like health regeneration, all bonuses remain as affective as vanilla.
- Hold block for 3 seconds without letting go of the button to gain +200% stamina regeneration boost until you let go. A mechanic inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
- Enemies take 25% more damage from melee attacks when struck from behind.
- Boss-type enemies become enraged during power attacks when above 25% stamina, taking drastically less physical and poise damage. Enrage is indicated by a faint red glow.
- After player reachers level 10, [Enhance Enemy Attributes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65861) scaling applies an additive, stacking +1.5% boost to enemy damage and health for every player's level.
  - This mechanic is intended to keep the game from becoming a boring pushover due to aggressive power creep from various perks, items and other buffs player can obtain.
  - For example, at level 60, enemies have (60 - 10) * 1.5% = 75% more health and damage.

## Alternative Death Mechanics

Vagabond Remastered changes the way death works in Skyrim with [Acheron](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108159?tab=description)

When you die on three outcomes will happen:
- You enter a bleedout state for 30 seconds, during which enemies will de-aggro and regenerate their health.
- You teleport to some nearby exterior location.
- You're teleported to one of the inns.

In select story-based locations where alt-death doesn't work well, the mechanic disables itself and your character simply dies like normal.

## Item Durability

Vagabond Remastered utilizes [Item Durability](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42544), which makes armor and weapons lose their tempering durability over time, the weapons can degrade all the way to zero durability, meaning they provide no armor nor damage.
However, the items can never completely break. The degration rate is set to be fairly slow to avoid the system feeling overly intrusive.

To help manage item degradation, the player can find or craft hammers and whetstones to temper their gear while away from town.

## Resistance Scaling

Vagabond Remastered changes the way in which resists are calculated with [Resistances Rescaled](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20503). 
The mod changes resistance scaling for both armor and elements to a hyperbolic formula, which essentially means every point of armor and every percentage of resistance benefits your *effective HP* (aka how long you can survive) by an equal amount.
This means that increasing armor or resistances will always benefit your character.
Your real, re-calculated resistances can be seen in the magic effect menu.

## Resistances and weaknesses

The list uses [Know Your Enemy 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93258) to introduce resistances and weaknesses depending on target type. 
Fairly moderate Level 2 intensity is used, meaning the mod only has minor impact on real combat and can be considered an optimization feature or an immersion mechanic.
Most mod-added creatures also follow the KYE2 rules through patches, but some are not fully integrated *yet*.

# Quests Changes

Vagabond Remastered changes a significant amount of vanilla quests in one way or another in order to offer a more complete roleplaying exprience.

While most can be accessed through [Skyrim Outfit System](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42162) if you want to use them purely for cosmetics, many have been re-integrated into the world as potential loot (or equipment that is unique to specific NPCs)

The list features many new weapon types, which are given unique movesets different from the vanilla weapon types.
