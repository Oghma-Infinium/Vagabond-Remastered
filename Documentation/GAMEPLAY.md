# Initial Setup

Before reading this guide, please follow the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/README.md) as it will answer the vast majority of technical questions related to getting the list setup and running. Be sure to check out the [Configuration](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md) page to learn more about the controller support, optional tweaks, addons, MCM options, and more.

# Overview and Basics

This section will cover the absolute basics of the list. I suggest reading, or skimming all of the linked mod pages in this section if you are unfamiliar with the preceding mods.

Before reading this section, I suggest looking over the [load order](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/vagabond-remastered-2) and [keybinds](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Vagabond-Remastered/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#gamepad-keybinds).

## Core Overhauls

 - Vagabond Remastered uses [Vokord](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129564) as the perk overhaul, with major custom modifications, such as custom Timed Block branch for the Block skill tree and a Weapon Arts skill tree. Additionally, some perks from [aljo's Paragon perks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120398) are added.

## Combat Foundations

The following mods are considered the "foundations" of the combat and gameplay for Vagabond Remastered:
 - [Attack MCO|DXP](https://www.distaranimation.com/mods/attack) (Maxsu edition) is the foundational overhaul for melee combat in the list.
 - [Spell Hotbar 2](https://github.com/pWn3d1337/Skyrim_SpellHotbar2) overhauls magic gameplay and is recommended to be used over vanilla casting.
 - [TK Dodge RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956) adds Dodging to the game.
   - Dodges are based on Armor Type. Heavy Armor and Cloth users gets a shorter step dodge with shortened iframes, Light Armor gets a longer roll dodge with longer iframes.
   - The Sneak skill tree has multiple perks to upgrade your Dodge efficiency.

   - The Block skill tree has multiple perks to upgrade Timed Block with additional effects and bonuses. 
 - **Custom Weapon Arts system**: Unlocked by taking the first perk in the Weapon Arts skill tree, allowing use of powerful special attacks.
   - The basic Weapon Art chooses an attack based on weapon type, but more can be obtained through various unique weapons.
   - By default, the Weapon Art of an unique weapon can be used only with that specific armament, but with the Artkeeper's Legacy perk from Weapon Arts skill tree, unique Weapon Arts become available while wielding any weapon.
   - Weapons featuring unique Weapon Arts can be crafted with **Void Shards** obtained from killing bosses. The exact recipes can be seen in the forge crafting menu when you have at least one Void Shard in your inventory.
   - Additionally, some daedric artifacts possess unique Weapon arts.

List of all unique Weapon Arts available in the list. New ones will be added over time as I update the list!

# Leveling and Progression

Vagabond Remastered modifies the vanilla leveling experience in a way to reward the player for engaging in the world in sensible ways. While perks can be obtained through leveling, the perks gained from leveling alone are unlikely to be sufficient for sustaining a full character build in late game. Below is a general breakdown of what to expect with the leveling and progression system in Vagabond Remastered.

## Changes to Leveling

Vagabond Remastered uses [Insightful Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79951) with a custom patch for [FTweaks Skill Increase Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/124253).
Insight can be obtained from:
- Enemies
- Bosses
- Some wildlife
- Dungeon chests
- Quests
- Skyshards (these do **NOT** grant perk points like the original mod)

Note that insight NOT granted from kills by followers / summons / other NPCs. You must get the killing blow yourself. The list is fundamentally designed for solo-play because that is what I enjoy.

## Perk Point Acquisition

Vagabond Remastered takes a mixed approach to the acquisition of perks. 

- Each level-up grants one perk point
- Dragon and unique boss kills grant one perk point, with a cap of 50 in a playthrough
- Grand Insight, a potion found as rare loot grants one perk point, with a cap of 20 in a playthrough
- With default start settings the player starts with 3 free perk points at level 1

# Difficulty Overhaul

|Difficulty |Damage Taken|Damage Dealt|Poise Damage Taken|Combat Stamina/Magicka Regen|Base Health Regeneration >50%|Base Health Regeneration <50%|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Novice |50% |120% |50%|100%|100%|100%|
|Apprentice|75% |110% |75%|100%|50%|100%|
|Adept |100%|100%|100%|100%|0%|100%|
|Expert |125%|90%|125%|50%|0%|0%|
|Master |150%|80%|150%|50%|0%|0%|
|Legendary |200%|70%|150%|50%|0%|0%|

# Gameplay Tips

- Soldier is a safe starting class choice. Rogue is very strong for dodge-based builds. Battlemage is the best option for spellsword gameplay.
- Recommended use for 3 starting perk points for melee focus: Timed Block, Weapon Art & 1H/2H mastery perk.
- Lady is a good early choice for Standing Stone if you don't have more specialized plans yet.
- Food buffs are VERY important for sustain. Remember that the list has food spoilage system, so don't hoard all food in inventory.

# New and Notable Mechanics

- Exhaustion system: when you run out of stamina, enter exhaustion state for 10 seconds or until you recover at least half of your max stamina. During exhaustion, weapon damage, poise damage and block efficiency is reduced by 50% and movement speed by 25%. NPCs are also affected by exhaustion.
- Hold block for 3 seconds without letting go of the button to gain +200% stamina regeneration boost until you let go.
- Enemies take 25% more damage from melee attacks when struck from behind.
- Boss-type enemies become enraged during power attacks when above 25% stamina, taking drastically less physical and poise damage. Enrage is indicated by a faint red glow.
- NPCs **below** player's level gain extra scaling of +1% melee damage, +5 health, +5 Armor and +0.5% Magic Resistance per level below player.
  - For example if Player is level 20 and enemy level 5, then enemy gains the bonuses above for 15x (20 - 5 = 15)

## Alternative Death Mechanics

Vagabond Remastered changes the way death works in Skyrim with [Acheron](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108159?tab=description)

When you die on three outcomes will happen:
- You teleport to the last bed you slept at. **This is the primary respawn method.**
- You enter a bleedout state for a few seconds, during which enemies will de-aggro and regenerate their health.
- You teleport to some nearby exterior location.
- You're teleported to one of the inns.

## Item Durability

Vagabond Remastered utilizes [Item Durability](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42544), which makes armor and weapons lose their tempering durability over time, the weapons can degrade all the way to zero durability, meaning they provide no armor nor damage.
However, the items can never completely break. The degration rate is set to be fairly slow to avoid the system feeling overly intrusive.

To help manage item degradation, the player can find or craft hammers and whetstones to temper their gear while away from town.

## Resistance Scaling

Vagabond Remastered changes the way in which resists are calculated with [Resistances Rescaled](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20503). 
The mod changes resistance scaling for both armor and elements to a hyperbolic formula, which essentially means every point of armor and every percentage of resistance benefits your *effective HP* (aka how long you can survive) by an equal amount.
This means that increasing armor or resistances will always benefit your character.

In practice this means that +50 armor rating equals to roughly +10% effective HP against physical attacks and +1% magic/elemental resistance to roughly +3% effective HP against resisted element.

Your real, re-calculated resistances can be seen in the magic effect menu.

## Resistances and weaknesses

The list uses [Know Your Enemy 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93258) to introduce resistances and weaknesses depending on target type. 
Fairly moderate Level 2 intensity is used, meaning the mod only has minor impact on real combat and can be considered an optimization feature or an immersion mechanic.
Most mod-added creatures also follow the KYE2 rules through patches, but some are not fully integrated *yet*.

# Lockpicking Overhaul

Lockpicking in Vagabond Remastered is no longer done with a minigame, it’s now a dice roll-based system driven by your character’s skill and gear. This new system, powered by the [Auto-Lockpicking](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59027) mod, removes the vanilla lockpicking minigame entirely and replaces it with a RPG-style dice roll mechanic. When attempting to pick a lock, the game performs a dice roll: you roll a number between 0 and 24. This number is then modified by your Lockpicking skill level, Security tree perks, and any gear, enchantments, or potions that affect lockpicking. This final result is compared to a lock's difficulty threshold. If your final roll meets or exceeds that threshold, the lock opens. Otherwise, it remains locked.

<Details>
<summary>Detailed explanation</summary>

1. Base Roll
Every time you try to pick a lock, a random number between 0 and 24 is rolled.

2. Skill-Based Bonus: your Security skill gives a flat bonus of +1 for every 10 skill levels.
For example:
-	At Security 50 → +5
-	At Security 100 → +10
- This means that at max skill, your rolls will range from 10 to 34.

3. Perk-Based Bonus
-	The first perk gives +2 at Rank 1 and another +2 at Rank 2.
-	The Locksmith perk grants an additional +4.
- With all perks and max skill, your dice roll can reach a range of 18 to 42.

4. Percentage Modifiers
For percentage bonuses 10% bonus equals +1 roll bonus.

Lock Difficulty Thresholds: each lock has a minimum required score that your final modified roll must meet or exceed.

| Lock Level | Required Final Roll |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Novice | 20 |
| Apprentice | 23 |
| Adept | 27 |
| Expert | 32 |
| Master | 38 |

Even though these values may seem relatively close, in practice the gaps make a considerable difference.

If your maximum possible final roll cannot exceed a lock's threshold, it’s impossible to unlock it, no matter how many times you try.

This means:
- Without perks or gear, you can only open Novice and Apprentice locks (and only if the roll is lucky enough).
- Higher-tier locks require investment in Security skill, perks, consumables and gear.

Example:
- Security skill: 100 → +10
- Perks: +8 total
- Base roll: 0–24 → Now 18–42
- Potion: +20% → +2 Bonus roll → Final roll range: 20 – 44

In this case, even Master locks (38) are reliably unlockable.

Tips:
- Early Game: Stick to Novice or Apprentice locks unless you have potions or enchanted gear.
- Security Tree: Invest in early perks to expand your possible roll range quickly.
- Use Potions & Enchants: These percentage boosts scale with your roll, making them very powerful.
- You can check your roll potential in Autolockpicking MCM. If your max potential roll is below a lock's threshold, you simply can’t open it yet.

# New Armors and Weapons

While most can be accessed through [Skyrim Outfit System](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42162) if you want to use them purely for cosmetics, many have been re-integrated into the world as potential loot (or equipment that is unique to specific NPCs)
